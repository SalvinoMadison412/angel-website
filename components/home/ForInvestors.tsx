            India loses 1,77,175 lives to road accidents annually. A large share of those deaths happen in the
            first hour after a crash — the window where Angel operates. We are not selling safety theatre. We are building the
            infrastructure that plugs the response gap, starting with the millions of riders on Indian roads
            every day who have no crash detection and no guaranteed emergency response when something goes
            wrong.
