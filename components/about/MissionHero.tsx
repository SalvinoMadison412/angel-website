              Angel started with a question our founders couldn't stop asking after a close friend was seriously
              injured in a highway collision: why does help still depend on someone conscious enough to call for
              it? Emergency response has barely changed in fifty years, while the vehicles it protects have
              transformed completely.

              We're a founding team building the network that should have existed all along — one where drivers,
              responders, tow fleets, hospitals, and insurers are connected before a crash ever happens.
