            Angel is a consumer product first. The Atom device and rider app are what people buy. The partner
            network is what makes the response possible.

            Most safety startups build one side of this equation — a consumer app, or a dispatch tool for
            responders — and hope a network forms around it. Angel builds both deliberately, because the value of
            each side depends entirely on the other.
